The purpose of the scripts below is generate a summary table from a spreadsheet of specimens that are being considered for accession to KU. The script also generates a new version of the original spreadsheet that is clear of common formatting errors and includes additional columns to indicate the protected status of each individual specimen. In addition to providing numbers of specimens in several categories (e.g., frogs, snakes) the resulting summary table identifies which specimens are domestic versus international and which species are protected under either CITES or US ESA. Protected taxa are identified by querying the accession spreadsheet against databases of taxa that are protected either by CITES or the US FWS's Endangered Species Act.
