The purpose of these scripts is to automate processing of data for specimens that are being considered for accession to KU. Taking a csv spreadsheet with specimen data as input, the script here generate a summary table of the data as well as a new spreadsheet that has been parsed for data and formatted in the preferred format for transfer to our Specify database. In addition to providing numbers of specimens in several categories (e.g., frogs, snakes) the resulting summary table identifies which specimens are domestic versus international and which species are protected under either CITES or US ESA. Protected taxa are identified by querying the accession spreadsheet against databases of taxa that are protected either by CITES or the US FWS's Endangered Species Act.
